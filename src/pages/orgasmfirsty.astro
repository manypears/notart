It is always being entered, but is in denial, fixated on penile ejaculation. Ecstasy is not only sexual, but it is always some small death. The sexual, also, is never a &lsquo;mere&rsquo; thing. Everything is a derivation, a reproductive role-play and always the perversion of it. A pleasurable perversion, productive of other faculties. Productivity is better remunerated than reproduction (economically). In fetishising the new, the most desirable labour is that of production, while reproduction is undersold. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">(Even sex work and surrogacy, which are true productive experiences of the body, are undervalued, for taint of reproduction.)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c9 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c8 c9"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c11 c8 c9">A male Orgasm</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man sits with a craned neck</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man looks at his crotch</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man calls it his loins</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">In the pink folds</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man sees eternity shriveling</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man broods over the thought</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">That all testicles are now filled with plastic</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Man frets over declining fertility rates</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mankind must be saved&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">What comes after production? <br>Singularity?

Reaching past life into eternal innovation, endless transcendence, the augmented human surpasses every past human and non-human experience of pleasure and performance, maybe even happiness. A self, augmented by technologies/selves, borrowing against their future, our future, the future of all beings. It finds absolute self-isolation, an entity in control of all its surroundings, possessing pure autonomy, able to decide definitively without any external pressures. Negating the existence of any other life that is not in service of it, that has not been digested by the </span><span class="c8">emergent social being</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Every myth sold is first wrapped. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">And even this is moved beyond while trawling for societal camaraderie, (embodied in transcendental emergent entity): a crude misdirected search for the ultimate extraterrestrial &lsquo;other&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">We were wrought from clay </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Porous vessels</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">We have dug further and found our, now, ideal carrier: </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">extruded from the accumulation of our deep forebears&rsquo; fossilised remains, indifferent to colour and opacity, plastic (as we are) in every sense.
