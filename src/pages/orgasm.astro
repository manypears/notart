In the beginning was  the word.
and the word  was without form.

To summarise in advance of saying… the masculine is reproductive surplus. It is always being entered, but is in denial, fixated on penile ejaculation. Ecstasy is not only sexual, but it is always some small death. The sexual, also, is never a ‘mere’ thing. Everything is a derivation, a reproductive role-play and always the perversion of it. A pleasurable perversion, productive of other faculties. Productivity is better remunerated than reproduction (economically). In fetishising the new, the most desirable labour is that of production, while reproduction is undersold. 
(Even sex work and surrogacy, which are true productive experiences of the body, are undervalued, for taint of reproduction.)


A male Orgasm

Man sits with a craned neck
Man looks at his crotch
Man calls it his loins
In the pink folds
Man sees eternity shriveling
Man broods over the thought
That all testicles are now filled with plastic
Man frets over declining fertility rates
“Mankind must be saved”



What comes after production? 
Singularity? An end? As with individual lives and lessons taught on mortality, all lives must amount to something. So too must all peoples. All of life, however delimited, will one day die/ change. Then, which apocalyptic embrace? The cosmic communist desire for self-annihilation. 
Ritual expansion and collapse

Or else the queued capitalist myth of eternal preservation, the heavenly desire never to reproduce, but to produce (externally frustrated)… to find stasis progress - a living death of dynamic equilibrium. 

Touch me instead or let me be touched
I wish to feel myself moving inside myself
In order to expel my futurity or hope thereof
A helpless hapless singular excretion

…utopic in that nothing everything changes. 
Beings are the museums of technology, and with it shared knowledge; the information embedded in bodies and our object burns, imperceptibly, in the (tepid?) decay of progress. 
What of something beyond this myth of eternal life? Reaching past life into eternal innovation, endless transcendence, the augmented human surpasses every past human and non-human experience of pleasure and performance, maybe even happiness. A self, augmented by technologies/selves, borrowing against their future, our future, the future of all beings. It finds absolute self-isolation, an entity in control of all its surroundings, possessing pure autonomy, able to decide definitively without any external pressures. Negating the existence of any other life that is not in service of it, that has not been digested by the emergent social being. 
Every myth sold is first wrapped. 
And even this is moved beyond while trawling for societal camaraderie, (embodied in transcendental emergent entity): a crude misdirected search for the ultimate extraterrestrial ‘other’.
We were wrought from clay 
Porous vessels
We have dug further and found our, now, ideal carrier: 
extruded from the accumulation of our deep forebears’ fossilised remains, indifferent to colour and opacity, plastic (as we are) in every sense. It takes any form, holds every form, and will never die. 

This is why I want to take you into me, be taken by you. Have you enter me and my male body. 
I am a bed of soil 
at once a living thing 
filled with living things.




While we were eating, Jesus took the bread and blessed it and gave it to us men. 
Take and eat; this is my body. 
We may only eat of the flesh of man when already feasting. 
To eat of the flesh, the flesh of man, we must first drink water and eat, 
not fruit but vegetable matter - the body of the plant. 
We may then eat of the flesh of herd animals. 

This desire

always negates the object of desire:
If I am hungry 
I eat the bread
And thus destroy the bread


We, men, must not eat excrement or the superfluous, nothing cast off from the body. 
The milk of beasts is unclean. So too is letted blood, 
but life-blood is clean; which is to be cooked into a cake and eaten. 
Only that which is of the body, that which cannot be cast off from the body, 
is clean for eating. We do not, at any time, consider ourselves satiated; 
only in surplus may we indulge in eating his flesh.   

This desire

always negates the object of desire:
If I am thirsty
I drink of the wine
and thus…
and thus…




Both bread and wine contain yeast from the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When S. yeast cells are starved it induces uniform cell cycle arrest. But, once they return to a food-rich environment that process is aborted and they recommence the reproductive cycle. 

(Grain and grape are womb & foetus
Yeast the taint of sex)

The byproducts of this process are ethanol and carbon dioxide. In this anaerobic phase, cells begin by growing uniformly. If they have not yet begun budding, the presence of pheromones triggers chemotropism, an asymmetrical growth directed by a chemical gradient. This prompts a non-uniform growth in which they form protuberances. When the tips of two cells’ protuberances touch, they fuse 
and then re-enter the division cycle. 

The        bread must be
Unleavened

Sexual reproduction is expensive because males don’t reproduce.

…the womb was with God…
no?

When man – both male and female – was created by God; God says “let us make man in Our image”. This occurs on the sixth day: the day of the creation of all land animals. When this gesture is initiated, an active voice is used with a direct address. Until this point, all of creation was a (singularly) productive act.


To make man in “the image of” marks a mimetic gesture, more specifically an act of self-replication. However, whether or not this act is reproductive is questionable. In their address, God uses the first person plural “Our” which is clearly indicative of divine plurality: the triune godhead. They are known to be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Both the father and son are phallic-corporeal while the spirit is yonic-incorporeal. Markedly sexed are the begetter and begotten; ancestry and futurity are superfluous masculine agents. Presence incorporeal (the ghostly maternal) has no voice and speaks no word. 

Animals are granted reproductive capacity, but image-bearer is granted, in addition, productive capacity. This capacity for production necessitates what? 




ownership: 


I was created in Their Image.
As bearer of Their Image, I have dominion. 
Over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth.
The depths, also
The skies, also
Let nothing be cast off or wasted 
I inherit the earth. 
I the inheritor  I the descended 
Take and eat for this is my body
sharing in one then another

The earth parades before me, I give it a name

It must become object so that I might desire it


a plumb line swells the core, feel it sit just above the breast bone And receive flushes of warming and cooling Try to dwell inside the urge Make (for) yourself the object for In consumption
Satiation

Satiation finitude 
Finitude death

Once fed we drop the line And the swelling returns. We might otherwise have forgotten It prompts the search for our lost tails Keeps fondling the hard bone at the base of our spine though The shameful nub hates being touched.


When was adam made man?
When he found the words to name the animals
When he tilled the land and wrought from it abstractions
When he took stock of  his named and thrust his fist inside them 

For stock must must grow
When he writ the tree of life - his own -
Filled with branching subordinates

The ‘other’ is being grafted
She too may take stock
posses
only

He is coming

For his bride


meanwhile
Do not neglect excess of consumption 
Feasting


The rigid indestructible byproduct of our ancestors’ remains. Find their way into our being

They shall look upon us, them whom we have pierced
From the opening poured forth
Blood and  
water
Immiscible 
Drink from this all of you 

The new        wine 
Unfermented
My surplus must be saved
